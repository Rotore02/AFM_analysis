data_analysis_functions module
===================
This module contains the functions that perform data analysis 
operations.

This module provides a set of functions that perform some
mathematical or statistical operations on the already corrected 
height values obtained from an AFM experiment. Each function performs 
a single operation and provides data with a specific meaning.

def height_distribution(
    height_values : np.ndarray
) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray] :
    """
    Generates the x and y axis of the plot that represents the 
    height distribution of the AFM image.

    This function returns the x and y axis of the plot that 
    represents the distribution of the heights inside the 
    `height_values` array. The height values are subdivided into 
    100 bins ranging from `height_values.min()` to 
    `height_values.max()` and the generated x axis of the 
    distribution plot is an array containing the bin centers.
    The function `np.histogram` is used to generate the y axis, 
    counting the amount of height values `z` falling in each bin. 
    The bins are defined as the intervals 
    [n⋅bin_width, (n+1)⋅bin_width), (including the left edge and 
    excluding the right edge) if n⋅bin_width <= `z` < (n+1)⋅bin_width, 
    with n integer that goes from 0 to 99.

    Parameters
    -----------
    height_values: ndarray
        2-d grid containing the height values.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of two ndarray
        x and y axis of height distribution plot.

    np.histogram : function that computes the histogram of a dataset.

def roughness_1d(

    """
    Computes the 1-d roughness of the image and its standard deviation.

    This function computes the 1-d roughness along each fast scan 
    direction of the image (x axis) and thenit returns the mean of 
    all these roughness values. This way of computing the roughness 
    allows to return also the standard deviation, which is often 
    taken as the uncertainty associated to the mean roughness value.
    Finally, the mean of each 1-d roughness values and its standard 
    deviation are written in `results_file` if its internal state 
    `enabled` is set to True.

    Parameters
    -----------
    height_values: ndarray
        2-d grid containing the height values.
    results_file: SmartFile
        File-like object that records results if its internal `enabled`
        flag is True.

    See Also
    --------
    np.std: function that computes the standard deviation along a 
    certain axis.
    np.mean: function that computes the arithmetic mean along a 
    certain axis.
    sm.SmartFile: class to create files on which it is possible to 
    write if their internal state `enabled` is set to True.
    roughness_2d: computes the roughness by exploiting the standard 
    deviation of all the image data.

    Notes
    -----
    The 1-d roughness expression for one fast scan direction is equal 
    to the standard deviation computed for the data in that line, 
    this is the reason for which the numpy standard deviation function
    is used to return the roughness in that direction.
