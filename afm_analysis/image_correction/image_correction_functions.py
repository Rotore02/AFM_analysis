image_correction_functions module
===================
This module contains the functions that perform image
correction operations.

This module provides a set of functions that modify
the height values of the AFM raw image data. Each function
manages the correction of a certain kind of systematic
error that occours during an AFM experiment.

    """
    Cancels out the planar slope of the image.

    Starting from the plane equation `z = a*x + b*y + c`, this 
    function subtracts `A*x + B*y + C` to the height values 
    of the AFM image, where the coefficients A and B are obtained 
    by minimizing the square displacement between the plane and 
    the height values. This is done to eliminate any planar 
    inclination due to sample positioning in the AFM microscope. 
    The plane parameters will be written in the results_file if 
    its internal state `enabled` is set to True.

    Parameters
    ----------

    eliminate systematic drifts due to temperature variations
