class SmartFile:

    Can be used to build a file-like object in which one can 
    dynamically write.

    This class can be used to create a file-like object in which an 
    action defined by its methods is performed only if its internal
    attribute `enabled` is set to `True`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    enabled: bool
        Checks wether the action is performed or not.
    file: str
        Name of the file to which the action is performed.

    Methods
    -------
    setup(file_name)
        sets the `enabled` attribute to `True` and opens the file.
    write(message)
        writes `message` to the file.
    close()
        closes the opened file.
